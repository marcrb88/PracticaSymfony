After the realitzation of this incorporation project I would like to highlight several points:

1. I would have liked emphasize more in the dessign ambit. Such as CSS, JavaScript to provide
a better visual impact on my project 

2. I am aware that there's a lack of control structures (check ID's random integer and you will
see it exists, for example)

3. Point 1 and 2 have to take into consideration that: 
    1. I haven't had the time I would have liked to dedicate to this evaluation test :(
    2. It was the first time that I programmed in PHP and, definitely, with Symfony framework.

4. However, I think I have satisfied the main required points that this evaluation project presents.
